# Flappy-Birb

**PG29 Unity 1 - Simple Game**

Date: 2025-12-14

## About the Project

This project is to create a simple game in Unity.

## What I did:
I decided to create flappy bird. There is both a menu/title screen as well as a game over screen. There is a score that keeps track of the amount of pipes you have made it through. It continues until you lose and quit the game.

## How To Use

**Step 1:** Make sure to have Unity installed. Version 6000.0.58f2.

**Step 2:** Add project from the repository, or by cloning the repository to your desktop.

**Step 3:** Open the project.
